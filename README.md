## Overview
prodversion is an extension of semantic versioning designed for production environments that can be used for software and hardware versioning.
- Encodes/decodes to a common 64 byte sequence across languages
- Provides additional and enumerable context about running software/hardware
    - Easily reference the exact commit
    - Clearly mark special variants
- Easy generation via build scripts & CI/CD solutions
- Verify software updates by product/part identifier & release channel

## Applications
- Hardware (PCB)
- Software/firmware
- Individual software modules/components
- Local databases

## Elements
- **Product/Part Identifier**: 25 character unique model number/part number
- **Semantic Version**
    - **Major**: breaking/major changes
    - **Minor**: additions and improvements
    - **Patch**: fixes
- **Build Number**: count of builds on this semantic version
- **Metadata**: optional string to be added for special variants/builds (2.0.1r-stripped)
- **Commit Hash**: 7 characters from Git commit SHA or TFS check-in
- **Release Channel**: character appended to version
    - `f` Factory variant
    - `d` Dev (non-functional development)
    - `i` Internal (semi-functional internal use)
    - `a` Alpha (functional testing-ready use)
    - `b` Beta (reliable unreleased build)
    - `c` Candidate (candidate for release)
    - `r` Release (production run)
- **Build Date**: UTC of build/design date

## Example
*Smart Toaster by ND Designs*
```C
//  Generated by build environment
prodVersion_t software = {
    .product = "ND SmartToaster FW",
    .major = 2,
    .minor = 1,
    .patch = 3,
    .metadata = "blefixtest",
    .commitHash = "24d08a4",
    .build = 32,
    .releaseChannel = VERSION_CHANNEL_INTERNAL,
    .date = UTC_TO_UNIX(2, 15, 2025, 9, 22)
};

//  Saved to EEPROM
prodVersion_t hardware = {
    .product = "ND SmartToaster DualSlot",
    .major = 1,
    .minor = 1,
    .patch = 0,
    .metadata = "",
    .commitHash = "4d0aa49",
    .build = 0,
    .releaseChannel = VERSION_CHANNEL_RELEASE,
    .date = UTC_TO_UNIX(12, 09, 2024, 15, 45)
};
```
